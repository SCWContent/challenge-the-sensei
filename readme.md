# Challenge The Sensei

Java is filled with little 'gotchas'.

> "Java Gotcha" - a common mistake pattern that is easy to accidentally implement.

Have you taken the "Challenge The Sensei" quiz?

- [scw.typeform.com/to/rgw7q7OE](https://scw.typeform.com/to/rgw7q7OE)

The above app uses the code examples in this repo as a fun 'can you spot the error?' multiple choice quiz.

When you've tried the quiz, then have a look at this repo for more commentary on the code.

And remember to share it with your friends to see if they can successfully complete the [Challenge the Sensei Quiz](https://scw.typeform.com/to/rgw7q7OE)

## Sensei

This repo is [Sensei](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14015-sensei-by-secure-code-warrior-) enabled.

When you clone this repo and load it into IntelliJ, and if you have the Secure Code Warrior Sensei IntelliJ Plugin installed, then it will automatically see that you have a `.sensei` folder, and load the Sensei recipes. When browsing the code in the IDE you should see IntelliJ prompt you that the error exists in the code:

- Hover over the highlighted code then you'll see a prompt telling you about the error
- Use the `Show Context Action` key: `alt+enter` (Windows) `option+enter` (macOS) and we may have a QuickFix available that can fix the code.

Sensei recipes have been added for:

- [Bitwise operators](/src/main/java/com/securecodewarrior/bitwiseoperators)
- [Split IP Address](/src/main/java/com/securecodewarrior/splitipaddress)
- [Assert Order](/src/test/java/com/securecodewarrior/assertorder)

We'll add more recipes and more explanatory text to cover the rest of the code in the future... but don't let that stop you having a look at the code and spotting the error yourself.
